    [Cogeneration improves separation
    efficiency](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c03190). *Industrial
    and Engineering Chemistry Research*.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">For most distillation systems, the heat pump
    (HP) compressor, upgrading the heat from condenser’s lower
    temperature to the reboiler’s higher temperature uses electrical
    energy that is only a fraction of the reboiler heat thereby making
    such processes highly efficient. However, the electricity utilized
    to power the heat pump compressor is typically dissipated as waste
    heat in cooling water. Here we propose a novel strategy termed
    “Separation Cogeneration” whereby most of the electrical energy
    supplied to the HP compressor is recovered as steam or process heat
    at or higher than the reboiler temperature. Through simulations of
    several industrially relevant distillations, we find that 79% to
    nearly 90% of the supplied compressor electrical energy can be
    recovered as usable steam/process heat. This is a remarkably high
    first-law efficiency of the distillation cogeneration system and is
    likely to make it the most efficient among the alternative processes
    for separations where distillation can be used. Furthermore, the
    availability of alternative HP schemes, leeway in the choice of
    approach temperature across the reboiler heat exchanger and the
    distillation column pressure along with the potential use of
    multi-effect distillation provide a great deal of flexibility in
    adjusting the temperature at which steam/process heat could be
    recovered. Through several industrially relevant case studies, we
    demonstrate that for a given separation and generation of the
    associated steam, the separation cogeneration requires nearly 40%
    less electricity when compared to the two-step process using
    conventional HP distillation and steam generation using electricity.
    The separation cogeneration strategy holds the promise to further
    the decarbonization goal of the industrial sector, facilitating the
    efficient utilization of electricity and reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions.</span></details>

    ensemble optimization problems and to obtain new convex hull results
    for multilinear polytopes. A computational experiment on
    multicommodity transportation problems with costs modeled using tree
    ensembles shows the practical advantage of our formulation relative
    to existing formulations of tree ensembles and other

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">This paper develops a correspondence
    relating convex hulls of fractional functions with those of
    polynomial functions over the same domain. Using this result, we
    develop a number of new reformulations and relaxations for
    fractional programming problems. First, we relate 0-1 problems
    involving a ratio of affine functions with the boolean quadric
    polytope, and use inequalities for the latter to develop tighter
    formulations for the former. Second, we derive a new formulation to
    optimize a ratio of quadratic functions over a polytope using
    copositive programming. Third, we show that univariate fractional
    functions can be convexified using moment hulls. Fourth, we develop
    a new hierarchy of relaxations that converges finitely to the
    simultaneous convex hull of a collection of ratios of affine
    functions of 0-1 variables. Finally, we demonstrate theoretically
    and computationally that our techniques close a significant gap
    relative to state-of-the-art relaxations, require much less
    computational effort, and can solve larger problem instances.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In this paper, we develop new discrete
    relaxations for nonlinear expressions in factorable programming. We
    utilize specialized convexification results as well as composite
    relaxations to develop mixed-integer programming (MIP) relaxations.
    Our relaxations rely on ideal formulations of convex hulls of
    outer-functions over a combinatorial structure that captures local
    inner-function structure. The resulting relaxations often require
    fewer variables and are tighter than currently prevalent ones.
    Finally, we provide computational evidence to demonstrate that our
    relaxations close approximately 60-70% of the gap relative to
    McCormick relaxations and significantly improves the relaxations
    used in a state-of-the-art solver on various instances involving
    polynomial functions.</span></details>

    [Piecewise polyhedral relaxations of multilinear

    Optimization*.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In this paper, we consider piecewise
    polyhedral relaxations (PPRs) of multilinear optimization problems
    over axis-parallel hyper-rectangular partitions of their domain. We
    improve formulations for PPRs by linking components that are
    commonly modeled independently in the literature. Numerical
    experiments with ALPINE, an open-source software for global
    optimization that relies on piecewise approximations of functions,
    show that the resulting formulations speed-up the solver by an order
    of magnitude when compared to its default settings. If given the
    same time, the new formulation can solve more than twice as many
    instances from our test-set. Most results on piecewise functions in
    the literature assume that the partition is regular. Regular
    partitions arise when the domain of each individual input variable
    is divided into nonoverlapping intervals and when the partition of
    the overall domain is composed of all Cartesian products of these
    intervals. We provide the first locally ideal formulation for
    general (non-regular) hyper-rectangular partitions. We also perform
    experiments that show that, for a variant of tree ensemble
    optimization problems, a formulation based on non-regular partitions
    outperforms that over regular ones by an order of magnitude.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In this paper, we describe the first
    mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)-based solution approach
    that successfully identifies the most energy-efficient distillation
    configuration sequence for a given separation. Current sequence
    design strategies are largely heuristic. The rigorous approach
    presented here can help reduce the significant energy consumption
    and consequent greenhouse gas emissions by separation processes.
    First, we model discrete choices using a formulation that is
    provably tighter than previous formulations. Second, we highlight
    the use of partial fraction decomposition alongside
    reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). Third, we obtain convex
    hull results for various special structures. Fourth, we develop new
    ways to discretize the MINLP. Finally, we provide computational

    minimization of power consumptions for multicomponent gas membrane
    cascades](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2023.108464).
    *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, *180*, 108464.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">As an emerging separation technology,
    membrane has been applied to many applications, among which many
    require the separation of a multicomponent feed into desired
    products. In this work, we developed an MINLP formulation that, for
    a given multi-component feed, identifies the minimum power
    consumption and the corresponding optimal membrane cascade
    configuration. This MINLP formulation can simultaneously guarantee
    global optimality and accuracy for multicomponent membrane cascades.
    In this formulation, we introduced a new approximation model for
    multicomponent membrane module, which is much simpler than the model
    obtained by conventional collocation method. We also introduce
    several auxiliary variables which help us solve cascades with 6
    components and up to 5 stages. We solved the resulting MINLPs to
    within 5% of global optimality. Finally we apply the algorithm to a
    H2 separation case and identified optimal membrane cascade
    configurations with 2, 3, and 4 compressors.</span></details>

    distillations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2024.108628).
    *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, 108628.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">Several optimization formulations exist in
    the literature for optimizing distillation configurations for
    unicomponent-product distillations (UPD), i.e., distillations where
    each product consists of only a single component. However, many
    separations either desire product streams composed of multiple
    components based on their end-use property requirements or tolerate
    such multicomponent products in exchange for savings in the
    objective, e.g., reductions in energy consumption. In this work, we
    propose an easy-to-use transformation that allows any UPD
    configuration to be used for multicomponent-product distillations
    (MPD) while controlling the composition of the product. This
    transformation is used in our optimization model to minimize the
    heat duty of MPD configurations derived from UPD for zeotropic
    separations. We apply this formulation to identify and rank
    energy-efficient configurations for an industrial crude petroleum
    case study, and show that the ordering of configurations on an
    energy efficiency basis is quite different using the MPD model
    compared to the UPD model.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">The constant molar overflow (CMO) framework,
    while useful for shortcut distillation models, assumes that all
    components have the same latent heats of vaporization. A simple
    transformation, from molar flows to latent-heat flows, allows
    shortcut models to retain the mathematical simplicity of the CMO
    framework while accounting for different latent heats, resulting in
    the constant heat transport (CHT) framework for adiabatic
    distillation columns. Although several past works have already
    proposed this transformation in the literature, it has not been well
    utilized in recent times. In this article, we show the utility of
    this transformation in upgrading various applications such as
    identifying energy-efficient multicomponent distillation
    configurations based on heat duty rather than surrogate vapor flow.
    The method transforms the Vmin diagram to a Qmin diagram.
    Furthermore, we derive new and insightful analytical results in
    distillation, such as cumulative latent-heat stage fractions having
    monotonic profiles within a distillation column under the CHT

    [An MINLP formulation to identify thermodynamically-efficient

    configurations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2023.108369).
    *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, *178*, 108369.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">Designing configurations for separation of
    multicomponent mixtures by distillation is challenging because
    of (i) combinatorial explosion of the choice set, and (ii) nonconvex
    nature of the governing equations. This work proposes a novel Mixed
    Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) that is formulated to identify
    configurations that minimize the total exergy loss/maximize
    thermodynamic efficiency of the separation process. The formulation
    in its default form has several nonlinear nonconvex equations. We
    propose a model reformulation via a simple variable elimination
    technique to reduce the system of nonlinear equations to a single
    equation, which we refer to as the exergy constraint. We describe
    the properties of exergy constraints and exploit them in deriving
    additional valid cuts for the problem. Finally, we use the model for
    a case study concerning the recovery of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs)
    from shale gas.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In this paper, we introduce new relaxations
    for the hypograph of composite functions assuming that the outer
    function is supermodular and concave extendable. Relying on a
    recently introduced relaxation framework, we devise a separation
    algorithm for the graph of the outer function over P, where P is a
    special polytope to capture the structure of each inner function
    using its finitely many bounded estimators. The separation algorithm
    takes O(dnlog(d)) time, where d is the number of inner functions and
    n is the number of estimators for each inner function. Consequently,
    we derive large classes of inequalities that tighten prevalent
    factorable programming relaxations. We also generalize a
    decomposition result and devise techniques to simultaneously
    separate hypographs of various supermodular, concave-extendable
    functions using facet-defining inequalities. Assuming that the outer
    function is convex in each argument, we characterize the limiting
    relaxation obtained with infinitely many estimators as the solution
    of an optimal transport problem. When the outer function is also
    supermodular, we obtain an explicit integral formula for this

    nonlinear formulation for the feasible set of sparse principal
    component analysis (PCA) and an alternative proof of the K-support
    norm. Second, we characterize the convex hull of sets of matrices
    defined by constraining their singular values. As a consequence, we
    generalize an earlier result that characterizes the convex hull of
    rank-constrained matrices whose spectral norm is below a given
    threshold. Third, we derive convex and concave envelopes of various

    heat pump distillation and membrane separation are discussed.
    Distillation generally requires lower power when either high
    component recoveries are needed (at all tested product purities), or
    high purity product streams with modest recoveries are needed. For
    high purity products at modest recoveries, membranes have a
    potential to provide energy benefits for highly enriched feeds,
    especially those composed of close boiling components. Additionally,
    when feed concentration is moderate to high and product recovery and
    purity are modest, membranes are likely to show efficiency gain. For
    the advantageous distillation scenarios studied, the power was
    generally lower than the membranes by a factor of two to

    novelty in the current model is that it can explore feasible heat
    integrations with a pre-specified desired minimum approach
    temperature between various condensers and reboilers while
    simultaneously optimizing the operating conditions within the
    configuration. We do not use cumbersome thermodynamic models for the
    equilibrium temperature calculation of a saturated multicomponent

    Antoine equation that reduces the calculation of the temperature at
    a given pressure to a simple function of component mole fractions
    and relative volatilities while retaining the fidelity of more
    complex models. We explore possible heat integrations by creating a
    heat exchange network between column condensers, reboilers, and side
    draw product locations. Considering these integrations along with
    the heat duty minimization is essential because it is often possible
    to alter the operating conditions of the columns and reduce energy

    problems with linear complementarity constraints and discuss how
    this procedure reduces to its standard specification for binary

    complementarity sets that appear in KKT systems with linear
    constraints. For sets with a single complementarity constraint, we
    develop a convexification procedure that generates all nontrivial
    facet-defining inequalities and has an appealing “cancel-and-relax”

    of problems with few side constraints in closed-form. As a
    consequence, we delineate cases when the factorable relaxation
    techniques yield the convex hull from those for which they do not.
    We then discuss how these results extend to sets with multiple

    potentially require a fraction of the energy used by distillation.
    This is primarily due to the widespread perception that thermal
    separation processes, particularly those that involve vaporization,

    the literature, many of which make ad-hoc assumptions and result in

    because the processes utilize different types of energy: heat and
    electricity. Here, we present a consistent framework that enables a
    fair comparison between different processes that consume different
    forms of energies. Using this framework, we refute the general
    perception that thermal separation processes are inherently the most
    energy intensive and conclusively show through the examples of two
    challenging mixtures constituting components with low relative
    volatilities, that distillation processes, when run properly, can
    consume remarkably lower fuel than non-thermal membrane
    alternatives, which have often been touted as more energy

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">Given the growing concern of reducing CO2
    emissions, it is desirable to identify, for a given separation
    carried out through a membrane cascade, the optimum design that
    yields the lowest power demand. Nevertheless, designing a membrane
    cascade is challenging since, there are often multiple feasible
    configurations that differ in their energy consumption and cost. In
    this work, we develop a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP)
    that, for a given binary separation, which may be either liquid or
    gaseous, finds the cascade and its operating conditions that
    minimize power requirement. To model the separation at each membrane
    in the cascade, we utilize the analytical solution of a system of
    differential and algebraic equations derived from the crossflow
    model and the solution–diffusion theory. We provide numerical
    evidence which shows that our single-stage membrane model accurately
    predicts experimental data. The resulting membrane model is
    non-convex and, even state-of-the-art solvers struggle to prove
    global optimality of the cascades and the operating conditions
    identified. In this paper, we derive various cuts that help with
    relaxation quality and, consequently, accelerate convergence of
    branch-and-bound based solvers. More specifically, we demonstrate,
    on various examples, that our cuts help branch-and-bound solvers
    converge within 5% optimality gap in a reasonable amount of time and
    such a tolerance level was not achieved by a simple formulation of
    the membrane model. The proposed optimization model is an
    easy-to-use tool for practitioners and researchers to design energy
    efficient membrane cascades.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In a multicomponent distillation
    configuration, there are numerous sources and sinks of heat, and a
    potential way to reduce the heat duty requirement is to perform heat
    integration. Unfortunately, an algorithmic search of the optimal
    heat integration opportunities is intractable when the required
    temperatures of intermediate streams are computed via complex
    models. Instead, in this work, we introduce pressure-scaled pseudo
    relative volatility, a new metric to compare stream temperatures. We
    justify the use of pseudo relative volatility by proving that this
    variable is a monotonically increasing function of the liquid
    fraction in a saturated mixture stream. Using this metric, we derive
    a shortcut criterion to check the feasibility of various heat
    integration opportunities, such as thermal coupling via heat
    transfer (TCH). The advantage of this approach is that it
    circumvents the need for explicit temperatures and instead relies on
    composition, component relative volatilities, and
    pressure—quantities that are readily available in shortcut models
    for optimization of distillation configurations. Leveraging this
    fact, we propose a new optimization framework that identifies
    feasible TCHs that we consider within the formulation while
    minimizing the total heat duty of a distillation configuration. We
    demonstrate, on a few examples, that our formulation can identify
    heat duty efficient configurations, some of which are multieffect
    configurations. Using this methodology, we discover configurations
    that are not only simpler than the fully thermally coupled (FTC)
    configuration but also have a much lower heat duty.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">Designing configurations for multicomponent
    distillation, a ubiquitous process in chemical and petrochemical
    industries, is often challenging. This is because, as the number of
    components increases, the number of admissible distillation
    configurations grows rapidly and these configurations vary
    substantially in their energy needs. Consequently, if a method could
    identify a few energy-efficient choices from this large set of
    alternatives, it would be extremely attractive to process designers.
    This paper develops such a method by solving a Mixed Integer
    Nonlinear Program (MINLP) that is formulated to pick, among the
    regular-column configurations of Shah and Agrawal (2010b), those
    configurations that have a low vapor-duty requirement. To compute
    the minimum vapor-duty requirement for each column within the
    configuration, we use techniques that rely on the Underwood’s
    method. The combined difficulty arising from the nonlinearity of
    Underwood equations and the combinatorial explosion of the
    choice-set of alternatives poses unmistakable challenges for the
    branch-and-bound algorithm, the current method of choice to globally
    solve MINLPs. To address this difficulty, we exploit the structure
    of Underwood equations and derive valid cuts that expedite the
    convergence of branch-and-bound by enabling global solvers, such as
    BARON, infer tighter bounds on Underwood roots. This provides a
    quick way to identify a few lucrative alternative configurations for
    separation of a given non-azeotropic mixture. We illustrate the
    practicality of our approach on a case-study concerning heavy-crude
    distillation and on various other examples from the

    In the new approach, the reboiler of a column is coupled with the
    condenser of another, through heat and mass integration in an
    additional section (HMA-section). The introduction of an HMA-section
    eliminates multiple connecting streams/valves, reduces the number of

    reduces the heat duty of the configuration. We exhaustively
    enumerate HMA-sections, and lay out a framework to identify all

    both heat integration and mass integration resulting from

    involves the coproduction of hydrogen and electricity from solar
    thermal energy and their judicious use to enable a sustainable
    economy. We identify and implement synergistic integrations while
    improving each of the two individual processes. When the proposed
    integrated process is operated in a standalone, solely power
    production mode, the resulting solar water power cycle can generate
    electricity with unprecedented efficiencies of 40–46%. Similarly, in
    standalone hydrogen mode, pressurized hydrogen is produced at
    efficiencies approaching ∼50%. In the coproduction mode, the
    coproduced hydrogen is stored for uninterrupted solar power
    production. When sunlight is unavailable, we envision that the
    stored hydrogen is used in a “turbine”-based hydrogen water power
    (H2WP) cycle with the calculated hydrogen-to-electricity efficiency
    of 65–70%, which is comparable to the fuel cell efficiencies. The
    H2WP cycle uses much of the same equipment as the solar water power
    cycle, reducing capital outlays. The overall sun-to-electricity
    efficiency of the hydricity process, averaged over a 24-h cycle, is
    shown to approach ∼35%, which is nearly the efficiency attained by
    using the best multijunction photovoltaic cells along with

    advantages: (i) It stores energy thermochemically with a two to
    three fold higher density, (ii) coproduced hydrogen has alternate
    uses in transportation, chemical, petrochemical industries,
    and (iii) unlike batteries, the stored energy does not discharge

    significant interest over the past several decades. A variety of
    relaxations for quadratically constrained quadratic programming
    (QCQP) can be formulated as semidefinite programs (SDPs). The
    primary purpose of this paper is to present a systematic comparison
    of SDP relaxations for QCQP. Using theoretical analysis, it is shown
    that the recently developed doubly nonnegative relaxation is
    equivalent to the Shor relaxation, when the latter is enhanced with
    a partial first-order relaxation-linearization technique. These two
    relaxations are shown to theoretically dominate six other SDP
    relaxations. A computational comparison reveals that the two
    dominant relaxations require three orders of magnitude more
    computational time than the weaker relaxations, while providing
    relaxation gaps averaging 3% as opposed to gaps of up to 19% for
    weaker relaxations, on 700 randomly generated problems with up to 60
    variables. An SDP relaxation derived from Lagrangian relaxation,

    uniform flow between every pair of nodes, we devise a
    polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm that minimizes flow
    disruption. The spiral structure of the optimal maintenance schedule
    sheds insights into general network maintenance scheduling. The
    maintenance problem on linear networks with a general flow structure
    is strongly NP-hard. We formulate this problem as a linear integer
    program, derive strong valid inequalities, and conduct a polyhedral
    study of the formulation. Polyhedral analysis shows that the
    relaxation of our linear network formulation is tight when
    capacities and flows are uniform. The linear network formulation is
    then extended to an integer program for solving the tree network
    maintenance scheduling problem. Preliminary computations indicate
    that the strengthened formulations can solve reasonably sized

    Unfortunately, state-of-the-art nonlinear programming codes are
    significantly slower and numerically unstable compared to linear
    programming software. In this paper, we facilitate the reliable use
    of nonlinear convex relaxations in global optimization via a
    polyhedral branch-and-cut approach. Our algorithm exploits
    convexity, either identified automatically or supplied through a
    suitable modeling language construct, in order to generate
    polyhedral cutting planes and relaxations for multivariate nonconvex
    problems. We prove that, if the convexity of a univariate or
    multivariate function is apparent by decomposing it into convex
    subexpressions, our relaxation constructor automatically exploits
    this convexity in a manner that is much superior to developing
    polyhedral outer approximators for the original function. The
    convexity of functional expressions that are composed to form
    nonconvex expressions is also automatically exploited. Root-node
    relaxations are computed for 87 problems from globallib and
    minlplib, and detailed computational results are presented for

    information from the modeler to the branch-and-bound solver. This
    effectively results into two models being passed from the modeling
    language to the solver. Three important application areas are
    identified and computational experiments are presented. In all
    cases, nonlinear constraints are provided only to the relaxation
    constructor in order to strengthen the lower bounding step of the
    algorithm without complicating the local search process. In the
    first application area, nonlinear constraints from the
    reformulation–linearization technique (RLT) are added to strengthen
    a problem formulation. This approach is illustrated for the pooling

    for pooling problems from the literature. In the second application

    optimality conditions for unconstrained global optimization
    problems. Computational experiments with polynomial programs
    demonstrate that this approach leads to a significant reduction of
    the size of the branch-and-bound search tree. In the third

    notion of a generating set, we establish conditions under which the
    tightest convex extension is the convex envelope. Then, we employ
    convex extensions to develop a constructive technique for deriving
    convex envelopes of nonlinear functions. Finally, using the theory
    of convex extensions we characterize the precise gaps exhibited by
    various underestimators of *x*/*y* over a rectangle and prove that
    the extensions theory provides convex relaxations that are much
    tighter than the relaxation provided by the classical
    outer-linearization of bilinear terms.</span></details>

    reformulates the problem at every node of the search tree. We
    demonstrate that this algorithm has a superior convergence behavior
    than directly solving the relaxation derived at the root node. The

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">In a recent work, we introduced the concept
    of convex extensions for lower semi-continuous functions and studied
    their properties. In this work, we present new techniques for
    constructing convex and concave envelopes of nonlinear functions
    using the theory of convex extensions. In particular, we develop the
    convex envelope and concave envelope of z=x/y over a hypercube. We
    show that the convex envelope is strictly tighter than previously
    known convex underestimators of x/y. We then propose a new
    relaxation technique for fractional programs which includes the
    derived envelopes. The resulting relaxation is shown to be a
    semidefinite program. Finally, we derive the convex envelope for a
    class of functions of the type f(x,y) over a hypercube under the
    assumption that f is concave in x and convex in y.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">We consider the product of a single
    continuous variable and the sum of a number of continuous variables.
    We show that “product disaggregation” (distributing the product over
    the sum) leads to tighter linear programming relaxations, much like
    variable disaggregation does in mixed-integer linear programming. We
    also derive closed-form expressions characterizing the exact region
    over which these relaxations improve when the bounds of
    participating variables are reduced. In a concrete application of
    product disaggregation, we develop and analyze linear programming
    relaxations of rational programs. In the process of doing so, we
    prove that the task of bounding general linear fractional functions
    of 0–1 variables is NP-hard. Finally, we present computational
    experience to demonstrate that product disaggregation is a useful
    reformulation technique for global optimization problems.</span></details>

    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">The purpose of this paper is to review some
    recent results that demonstrate the importance of identifying global
    optima of MINLP formulations. We present two global optimization
    “success stories” based on the application of global optimization
    techniques to two design problems. The first application deals with
    the design of just-in-time flowshops. On a collection of nine
    problem instances with only four degrees of freedom, global
    optimization provides solutions that average 17% cost savings
    compared to designs identified earlier in the literature using local
    search techniques. The second application deals with design at the
    molecular level and involves a considerably larger design space for
    identifying a replacement of Freon. The problem is difficult and has
    been approached by numerous research groups in the past. Global
    optimization identifies many novel molecular structures.</span></details>

    *Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research*, *38*(5), 1956–1972.
    <details open><summary>Abstract</summary><span class="csl-block">Pooling and blending problems occur
    frequently in the petrochemical industry where crude oils, procured
    from various sources, are mixed together to manufacture several
    end-products. Finding optimal solutions to pooling problems requires
    the solution of nonlinear optimization problems with multiple local
    minima. We introduce a new Lagrangian relaxation approach for
    developing lower bounds for the pooling problem. We prove that, for
    the multiple-quality case, the Lagrangian approach provides tighter
    lower bounds than the standard linear-programming relaxations used
    in global optimization algorithms. We present computational results
    on a set of 13 problems which includes four particularly difficult
    problems we constructed.</span></details>
